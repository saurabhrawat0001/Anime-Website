<h1 align="center"><b>DETAILS RELATED TO ENDING</b></h1>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Monster's ending was packed with small 
details that were easy to miss. Here's what you need to know.</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img12/3.jpg"><img src="img12/3.jpg" height="350px" width="450px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px" align="justify">Monster, whether in its original manga 
form or Studio Madhouse's anime adaptation, is a critically revered story and a cult classic. A psychological thriller that deals with 
philosophical themes, such as the nature of good and evil, as well as the tension between hedonism and nihilism, there's always 
something to further explore in Naoki Urasawa's magnum opus.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Rather unsurprisingly, the story's ending was quite divisive, leaving many fans feeling 
unsatisfied. But taking a deeper look into its content reveals that there's more to it than initially meets the eye. Here are two 
things that you may have missed in Monster's ending. Be warned that heavy SPOILERS lie ahead.</p></font>
<br>
<h2><b>1. The Purpose Of Wolfgang Grimmer's Death</b></h2>
<br>
<center><a href="img12/4.jpg"><img src="img12/4.jpg" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Grimmer is a fan-favorite character, 
and his death made fans very emotional. But to many people, he seems to have died in vain, as he wanted to reveal Franz Bonaparta to 
the world and make him confess his crimes. Bonaparta later dies anyway, meaning that Grimmer's desire can never come true.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Rather, Grimmer's death serves another purpose entirely. It redeems Bonaparta. Many of the 
characters in Monster are, in a way, monsters. Bonaparta is no exception, being the instigator of many of the story's tragedies. But 
Grimmer's death serves to humanize his character. It emotionally moves him to the point where he regrets his past experiments and begins 
to seek atonement.</p></font>
<br>
<h2><b>2. Circular Ending</b></h2>
<br>
<center><a href="img12/2.jpg"><img src="img12/2.jpg" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">This is surely one of the most 
memorable scenes of Monster's finale, if not one of the most memorable scenes of the whole show. Here, Tenma ends the story as 
he began it, by conducting surgery to save Johan's life. This is an example of circular storytelling, where a story's beginning 
and ending are linked.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">More importantly, this represents how Tenma has managed to stay true to his ideals. 
Though Johan tried so hard to turn him into a murderer, he failed. In the end, Tenma is still as strong as ever, dedicated to life 
and bound by the Hippocratic Oath.</p></font>
<br>
<h3><b>Did Johan Really Survive?</b></h3>
<br>
<center><a href="img12/1.jpg"><img src="img12/1.jpg" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">As expected of a multi-layered story 
like Monster, the finale concludes with one final mystery. Johan's empty hospital bed could mean a number of things. Of course, the 
open window nearby seems to suggest that Johan fled and escaped. But the earlier scene where Tenma confronts Johan complicates 
things.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">There is a moment where Johan suddenly rises from his slumber to "speak" to Tenma about 
his mother. But when Johan finishes, Tenma blinks and Johan is once again sleeping. This heavily implies that what Tenma saw was no 
more than a hallucination. But this begs the question: if Tenma hallucinated Johan speaking to him, who's to say he didn't hallucinate 
Johan's existence? Perhaps Tenma never saved Johan at all, and he is simply speaking to Johan's corpse, or even an empty bed. And if 
Tenma didn't save Johan, was it out of his control, or did he allow him to die on purpose?</p></font>
