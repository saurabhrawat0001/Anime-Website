the tritagonist of the series, becoming a major character halfway through the story. He is a survivor of Kinderheim 511. He is trained 
as a spy, and travels around Germany posing as a freelance journalist, but is in actuality trying to uncover more information about 
Kinderheim 511 and his past.</p></font>

     <hr color="yellow" size="1">
<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<br>
<center><a href="img05/2.png"><img src="img05/2.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Wolfgang Grimmer is a freelance 
journalist, who in fact, investigates about child abuse and psychologically reprogramming and travels around the places that he 
considers, might be related to it. Grimmer very early reveals that he was trained as a spy during the old regime which hints on 
his good investigative skills.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">In Dresden, he stumbles upon a free storeroom of a former journalism company. He is 
allowed by the principle to copy the old archives regarding data about the welfare system of former East Germany.  Grimmer promises 
that he will write an article that will bring the truth to light. Grimmer also says that the next location where he heads is Prague, 
in Czech Republic.</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img05/3.png"><img src="img05/3.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Grimmer first encounters Kenzo Tenma at
the train station, when Tenma helps him to pull the bag through the entrance. Tenma attempts to illegally cross the border from Germany 
to the Czech Republic. The two converse a bit, and then a police officer enters their division to check the men's passports. Grimmer 
picks up on Tenma's uneasiness and identifies that he is using a fake passport, so he helps him to escape before he can be apprehended 
by the guards. To ensure Tenma's security, he jumps off the train as well to give him tips on crossing the border safely. They have a 
picnic, then as dusk falls they part ways, promising to have another picnic the next time they meet.</p></font>
<br>
<h3><b>Mikhail Petrov</b></h3>
<br>
<center><a href="img05/4.png"><img src="img05/4.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Grimmer arrives in Prague and begins 
investigating a man by the name of Petrov who was once the headmaster of Kinderheim 511, the institution he is trying to gather 
information on. At first, Petrov is resistant to speak with Grimmer, and even arranges for some men to finish him off in his hotel 
room (naturally, Grimmer evades the encounter). He continues to narrow in on Petrov, and, upon following him to his apartment, 
realizes the man is currently running an illegal orphanage in his home, consisting of about a dozen young schoolboys. At first 
he is worried that Petrov is trying to recreate the Kinderheim experiments, but then realizes that the boys here have been raised
with love, not hate. As Grimmer takes the boys out to play soccer, Johan Liebert comes in dressed as his sister and shoots Petrov. 
By the time he arrives back, Petrov is on his deathbed. Before passing away, the man gives Grimmer the key to a safety deposit box 
where he can find an interview with Kinderheim's "monster". As the boys are sent off to different orphanages, Grimmer hands one of 
them the key and asks that he hold onto it until they meet again.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Being the first witness on the scene, he is questioned by the police. His interrogator, 
Inspector Zeman, is actually a member of the former Czech Secret Police and wants to be in possession of the tape. He catches up with 
Grimmer at a later time and brutalizes him to a half-dead state. "Anna Liebert" mysteriously shows up around that time and kills one 
of the three torturers, triggering Grimmer's "Magnificent Steiner" personality; he beats the remaining two to death. </p></font>
<br>
<h3><b>Jan Suk</b></h3>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Jan Suk, a rookie detective who is 
investigating the</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img05/5.png"><img src="img05/5.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">murder of these three men as well as 
Petrov, places Grimmer as a suspect of interest in both cases. He visits some of the orphaned boys and one of them announces that they
are actually planning to meet with Grimmer and play soccer one last time (the boy will also give him back the key). Suk tags along 
and meets with Grimmer, obtaining his hotel information so they can keep in contact. As they continue to meet, it becomes apparent 
to Suk that Grimmer isn't the killer; he also learns a lot of secrets about the Czech Secret Police and some of his colleagues, 
putting him in a dangerous position. Some of the double agents working at the station frame Suk for murder, forcing him to go on 
the run. Grimmer and Suk work together to preserve the tape's safety as well as their own lives.</p></font>
<br>
<h3><b>Kenzo Tenma</b></h3>
<br>
<center><a href="img05/6.png"><img src="img05/6.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Tenma, who arrived in Prague at the
same time as Grimmer, reads about Suk's case in the newspaper and can't help but realize the three superiors poisoned with whiskey 
bon-bons situation sounds all too familiar. He meets with Jan's mother who, in a confused state, believes him to be her son as a 
child; she taunts him about knowing where his secret hiding place is. Tenma travels to that building and finds Grimmer and Suk in 
a bloody mess. It appears as though his "Magnificent Steiner" ability awoke once more to kill the hit men. After performing first-aid, 
he and Grimmer check into a hotel room. There, Grimmer reveals to Tenma that he was once enrolled in Kinderheim 511.</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img05/7.png"><img src="img05/7.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Tenma and Grimmer are contacted by 
Karel Ranke, the former head of the secret police, who offers the safe return of Suk in exchange for the tape. They agree with the 
condition that the three of them listen to it first. During their meeting, Ranke talks about Franz Bonaparta and the Mansion of Red 
Roses. He also speaks about a boy named Adolf Reinhardt, his nephew whom he sent to Kinderheim 511 many years ago; this triggers 
Grimmer's memory as Adolf had been his best friend.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">The men get the tape from Jan's mother and start listening to it. Halfway through the 
interview though, they discover that someone has tampered with it, recording their own message over its contents. Tenma identifies 
the voice to be present-day Johan.</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img05/8.png"><img src="img05/8.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Meanwhile, the children of Petrov's 
former orphanage are working to prove Grimmer's innocence by finding "The Blonde Lady", whom they believe is responsible for killing 
him. Milosh finds "her", and they converse about why he is an orphan and whether or not his mother loved him. Ultimately, "she" sends 
him off to a red light district in search of his mom, and when he realizes there is no hope he tries to kill himself by jumping off a 
bridge. Grimmer and Tenma catch up with him just in time though, and are able to prevent his suicide.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Suk is still recovering in the hospital, and Grimmer wants to ensure that when he comes 
out he doesn't spend the rest of his life -- or any time at all -- in prison. Therefore, he writes a letter to the police confessing 
to all the murders, much to Tenma's dissatisfaction. The men visit one of Bonaparta's former editors, Tomas Zobak, and then part ways: 
Grimmer leaves Prague and Tenma is arrested.</p></font>
<br>
<h3><b>Ruhenheim</b></h3>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">He is later seen in Ruhenheim, as it 
seems he has come to the same conclusion Heinrich Lunge did that Franz Bonaparta is living there. The two of them try to stop the 
massacre from occurring, but their attempts result in failure. After confronting Franz Bonaparta, he claims he will protect him with 
his life until the day that he goes public with everything</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img05/9.jpg"><img src="img05/9.jpg" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">he did to those poor children at 
Kinderheim 511 and the Red Rose Mansion. Unfortunately, he encounters a near death situation and "The Magnificent Steiner" doesn't 
show up, so he finds that he as Wolfgang Grimmer is also capable of killing someone. In the process he receives some fatal injuries, 
and his life begins to fade away as Tenma shows up with Bonaparta and Wim following closely behind. Grimmer introduces them and 
comments that he hopes one day he, Tenma, and Wim can go on a picnic together. In the last few minutes of his life, he begins to 
cry for the death of his son he remained impassive to so many years ago. He proclaims that people can't ever lose their emotions; 
they might disappear for a while like a letter lost in the mail, but they will always prevail in the end. He also says that in the 
last episode of "The Magnificent Steiner" he was never able to see, that fearsome beast probably became human again.</p></font>
<br>
<h3><b>The End</b></h3>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Later, Fritz Verdemann is seen with 
Lunge and Suk gathered around his grave. They all pay their respects and Lunge places a beer next to his gravestone, saying that he 
probably had many things he wanted to talk about over a good drink.</p></font>

     <summary><b>Personality</b></summary>
 <hr size="1" color="yellow">
     <font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Grimmer is a wonderful man who is 
always found smiling, no matter how difficult situation would befall him. He is very concerned for the well-being of others, especially 
children, and wants to ensure the best possible futures for them. At first glance he seems to be a modest person who finds joy even in 
the simplest things life can offer. However, due the treatment he experienced in 511 Kinderheim, he's actually not able to feel real 
emotions like joy, love or sorrow. Despite this issue he's trained as a spy and is a very quick thinker, which gets him out of sticky 
situations.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">He is not a type of person who gets hurt easily, actually, it hurts him more when he sees 
others being in</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img05/10.png"><img src="img05/10.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">trouble or suffer unfairly. He even 
offered to give his shoe to a boy who cried because his shoes were taken by peers. Grimmer managed to comfort the boy and teaches 
him not to be brought down by losers but to move upwards because people are born without shoes.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">He is favoured by children because he is entertaining and careful and that is seen during
the Prague arc, when he was trying to free orphans from Petrov's care that was supposedly the continuous 511 experiment. It turned out 
to be the opposite after he noticed kids laughing at his clumsy move in soccer game.  The kids were trying at all costs to prove 
Grimmer's innocence and risked their life when one of them, Milosz confronted Petrov's murderer. In Ruhenheim, he easily earned 
Wim's respect when Wim was crying witnessing Grimmer's death.</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img05/11.png"><img src="img05/11.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Despite his precious nature, he's 
incapable of feeling emotions and isn't able to express them as naturally. As a result of this, wife left him after his son died 
because he wasn't able to cry at the funeral. This is the outcome of Kinderheim 511 experiments and Grimmer couldn't reach his 
emotions for years. He was finally able to shed a tear when he saved Milosz from committing suicide. When he was dying in tears, 
he asked if this is the true happiness  because he finally learned how to cry. For Grimmer it was hardest to learn how to smile, 
he was very often seen smiling even when talking about tragedies</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Grimmer was cheated by local hobo when a man mourned that he doesn't have money to help 
his sister in Vienna</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img05/12.png"><img src="img05/12.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">who collapsed. Man runs away after 
Grimmer gives him money and what we would expect from an average character is anger but instead, we see Grimmer smiling just after 
he realizes that he was cheated when a passer tells him so.</p> 
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">He believes in good of people and tried to prove it when he was staying at the middle 
of a street in Ruhenheim, shouting at the windows from where the shots flew, trying to convince others to stop making a chaos and 
listen to their own heart instead of someone's order. That unfortunately ended in failure.  </p></font>
<br>
<h3><b>The Magnificent Steiner</b></h3>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Grimmer possesses an alternative 
personality referred to as "The Magnificent Steiner." As a child in Kinderheim 511, the instructors conducted an experiment to 
see if they could get him to manifest a different personality by simultaneously exposing him to excessive amounts of TV and 
stressful conditions. In result, Grimmer, when put in a near death situation, becomes an extraordinarily violent creature, 
something you could probably call more of a beast than a human.</p></font>

     <summary><b>Timeline</b></summary>
 <hr size="1" color="yellow">
     <font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Grimmer was born in 1954 
(will gather more information and add to this later)</p></font>
<br>
<h3><b>Background</b></h3>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Grimmer attended Kinderheim 511 until 
he was fourteen. In there, he lost almost all of his memories. The only piece of information he could remember was his friend, Adolf 
Reinhardt (Roberto). Adolf's parents were killed crossing the Berlin Wall. He loved drawing and insects, but hated bug collectors 
because they killed the bugs; he always let them free. He cherished his weekly hot cocoa, but when Grimmer was sick, gave him his. 
Roberto, in turn, probably knew some information about Grimmer, maybe even his real name, but he died before anything could be 
revealed. He was also stripped of his emotions, and says that the hardest thing for him to ever learn was how to smile.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">After leaving Kinderheim 511, Grimmer was trained as a spy. One day a woman confessed 
her love for him, so he married her, because he was told having a family was a good cover up for someone of his position. The two of 
them had a son together, and they lived happily, until their son mysteriously and unexpectedly died. Grimmer's wife said he was to 
blame, because he was incapable of loving and had nothing in his heart. He couldn't even cry at his own son's funeral.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Before dying in Ruhenheim, he says the tears streaming down his face aren't because he 
feels his life fading away. Instead, they are the tears he should have cried for his son all those years ago. He says that people 
can't lose their emotions, and proves to the audience once and for all that The Magnificent Steiner was still a human, no matter 
how beastly he may have seemed.</p></font>

<h3><b>Another Monster</b></h3>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Main article: Another Monster Grimmer 
left behind a notebook containing details of everything he uncovered about Kinderheim 511. He also comments on Das Ruhenheim and the 
Sleeping Monster, the latter he mistakes for Bonaparta's work.</p></font>
