<font style="font-size:20px;color:orange;"><p align="justify">Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a nameless 
monster.</p>
<p align="justify">The monster was dying to have a name.</p>
<p align="justify">So the monster made up his mind, and set out on a journey to look for one.</p>
<p align="justify">But the world was such a very large place.</p>
<p align="justify">The monster split in two, and went on separate journeys.</p>
<p align="justify">One went east.</p>
<p align="justify">The other headed west.</p>
<p align="justify">The one who went east came upon a village.</p>
<p align="justify">There was a blacksmith who lived at the village's entrance.</p>
<p align="justify">"Mr. Blacksmith, please give me your name!" said the monster.</p>
<p align="justify">"I can't give you my name!" replied the blacksmith.</p>
<p align="justify">'If you give me your name, I'll go inside you and make you strong," said the monster.</p>
<p align="justify">"Really?" said the blacksmith, "If you make me stronger, I'll give you my name."</p>
<p align="justify">The monster went into the blacksmith.</p>
<p align="justify">And so, the monster became Otto the blacksmith.</p>
<p align="justify">Otto was the strongest man in town.</p>
<p align="justify">But then one day he said, "Look at me! Look at me! The monster inside of me is getting bigger!"</p>
<p align="justify">Munch munch, chomp chomp, gobble gobble, gulp.</p>
<p align="justify">The hungry monster ate up Otto from the inside out.</p>
<p align="justify">Once again, he was a monster without a name.</p>
<p align="justify">Next, he went into Hans the shoemaker.</p>
<p align="justify">However...</p>
<p align="justify">Munch munch, chomp chomp, gobble gobble, gulp.</p>
<p align="justify">Once again, he went back to being a monster without a name.</p>
<p align="">Then, he became Thomas the hunter.</p>
<p align="justify">But soon...</p>
<p align="justify">Munch munch, chomp chomp, gobble gobble, gulp.</p>
<p align="justify">Back he went to being a monster without a name.</p>
<p align="justify">The monster next went to a castle to look for a nice name.</p>
<p align="justify">He came upon a very sick boy who lived in that castle.</p>
<p align="justify">"If you give me your name, I'll make you strong," said the monster.</p>
<p align="justify">The boy replied, "If you can make me healthy and strong, I will give you my name!"</p>
<p align="justify">So the monster jumped right into the boy.</p>
<p align="justify">And the boy became full of vigor.</p>
<p align="justify">The king was overjoyed.</p>
<p align="justify">He announced, "The prince is healthy! The prince is strong!"</p>
<p align="justify">The monster became quite fond of the boy's name.</p>
<p align="justify">He was also quite pleased with his royal life in the castle.</p>
<p align="justify">So he controlled himself no matter how ravenous his appetite became.</p>
<p align="justify">Day after day, despite his growing hunger, the monster stayed put inside the boy.</p>
<p align="justify">But finally, the hunger just became too great...</p>
<p align="jusitfy">"Look at me! Look at me!" said the boy, "The monster inside of me has gotten this big!"</p>
<p align="justify">The boy devoured the king and all his servants.</p>
<p align="justify">Munch munch, chomp chomp, gobble gobble, gulp.</p>
<p align="jusitfy">The castle was lonely now with everyone gone, so the boy left on a journey.</p>
<p align="justify">He walked and walked for days.</p>
<p align="justify">And then one day, the boy came upon the monster who had gone west.</p>
<p align="justify">"I have a name!" said the boy, "And it's such a wonderful one at that!"</p>
<p align="justify">But the monster who went west replied, "Who needs a name? I'm perfectly happy without one. After all, that's what 
we are - nameless monsters."</p>
<p align="justify">The boy ate up the monster who went west.</p>
<p align="justify">At last he had found a name, but there was no longer anyone to call him by it.</p>
<p align="justify">Such a shame, because Johan was such a wonderful name.</p></font>
