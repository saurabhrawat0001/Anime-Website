<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Of course it would be obvious to see 
how Johan is the real monster. I mean, just look at everything he has done.</p></font>
<br>

<br><br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">-He caused the people in his orphanage 
to start killing each other, ending in the massacre of Kinderheim 511.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">-He did the same thing to a village in order to kill Franz Bonaparta.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">-He orchestrated the murders of a countless amount of people by trying to kill off 
everybody who knew him.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">-He is the reason for the fire at the library (poor books!), trying to kill a couple 
hundred of important people in order to ultimately kill one man.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">-He basically caused many children to commit suicide because of his "game" idea.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">-He endlessly used people for his own gain and helped people commit sins.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">He was seen as a monster by Wim's father who shot him in the head in order to protect 
Wim.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">There are most likely other reasons that help contribute to how he is called a monster 
(can't fully remember all 72 episodes), but the last episode really made me wonder. It's called "The Real Monster" and surprisingly 
it's where we learn about the mother of Johan and Nina. So after seeing the ending, it came to me that maybe the mother is the real 
monster. Maybe she is the one who started it all.</p></font>

<br><br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">This woman may look nice, but what 
she would do in the future is just awful. A few episodes before the end Nina mentioned a memory that she remembered saying that if 
Johan remembered it, it would be bad. It wasn't until the end until we see this memory and it's probably what made Johan turn into 
a monster.</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img10/3.gif"><img src="img10/3.gif" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br><br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">So before Nina got carried away for 
experimentation at the mansion and saw all those people dying, the mother actually had a choice on what child would go. Both Johan 
and Nina looked the same, perhaps to make the choice harder between the mother, but she ends up choosing Nina to go and Johan to stay 
behind. Based on what happened, Johan was left wondering if she really meant for him to go, making him believe he was unwanted, or 
that the mother wanted to protect him for some reason. Since he was dressed as Nina he would never really know whether he did it to 
protect her or so that he can go in her place. Either way, after that event all the craziness began that made the children the way 
they are.</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img10/4.jpg"><img src="img10/4.jpg" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br><br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">So ultimately, it can be said that 
the mother is the real monster for giving one of her children away. It's all up to us on what we believe but I believe that she is 
the real monster since because of her, Nina saw true horror and Johan became insane in a way. From that experience Johan was unsure 
on how much he meant to others so that may be what sparked his plans in the future. Johan may be a monster, but he is not the real 
monster.</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img10/5.jpg"><img src="img10/5.jpg" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br><br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Maybe that is why he disappeared at 
the end. He may have left to commit suicide or to cause havoc but we never will know. All we know is that he has a name and that he 
wasn't in the hospital bed when Tenma left. Even at the end, there are still mysteries! Monster is such a masterpiece and I am so 
glad to have watched it. The plot was great, the characters were memorable, and every episode made me want to watch the next one. 
I recommend everyone to watch it if they can.</p>
