    <br>
    <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Doctor Kenzo Tenma was a promising 
young neurosurgeon who worked at Eisler Memorial Hospital in Dusseldorf, Germany. He moved to the city from Japan after reading a 
paper apparently written by the hospital's director, Udo Heinemann. Heinemann quickly recognized Tenma's skills as a surgeon and 
took him under his wing. Through this partnership, the young doctor soon was introduced to and became engaged to the director's 
daughter, Eva Heinemann; an arrangement promising a bright and lucrative future ahead of him.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">One day, Tenma was ordered to operate on an opera singer and performed the surgery just 
as he was told.</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="Images02/1648376048473.jpg"><img src="Images02/1648376048473.jpg" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
 <br>
     <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">However, later that day he was 
confronted by a Turkish woman and her son in the hospital's lobby. Hitting him in her grief, she insisted that her husband (now 
deceased) had been brought into the hospital before the other patient and deserved to have been seen first. She blamed Tenma for 
her husband's death, and said that if he had been there to operate on him, he surely would have lived. Dazed, Tenma looked more 
deeply into the matter and came to realize that the opera singer had in fact been brought in after the Turkish man, and therefore, 
shouldn't have received treatment first. At this, the first crack in his confidence in the system and his role within it began to 
crumble.</p></font>

    <br>
 <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">A few days later, in April of 1986, he 
received a call in the middle of the night instructing him to perform surgery on a young boy with a gunshot wound to the head. Tenma 
arrived at the hospital in a moment's notice, ready to operate.</p></font>

 <center><font style="font-size:20px;color:orange;"><p>Dr. Oppenheim giving Tenma the phone with Udo Heinemann on the line</p>
</font></center>
 <br>
 <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">At the last second though, his 
surgical team was interrupted because he had received yet another call, this one now ordering him to let Doctor Becker operate 
on the boy to have him work on the town's Mayor Roedecker instead. Under ordinary circumstances Tenma, the director's unwitting 
tool, would have switched patients without hesitation due to his blind trust and sense of duty, but after his confrontation with 
the Turkish woman a few days before, he no longer was certain how to proceed or how to appropriately tackle this moral dilemma. 
In the end, he refused his superior's orders and carried out the initial surgery on the boy, committing to honor his Hippocratic 
Oath - a reoccurring moral dilemma which continued to torment Tenma throughout the series. In this instance, due to honoring his 
choice, Tenma successfully saved the child's, however, at the cost of the town mayor's. Deemed responsible for the wealthy and 
prominent man's death by the head physician and his jealous colleagues, the illusion of Tenma's perfect life begins to shatter. 
The mounting tension fully disintegrates at a business banquet when the head of neurosurgery is called upon to speak a few words. 
While Tenma prepares to approach the stage due to his established position, another doctor walks up instead. Dubbed irresponsible 
and rebellious for going against the director's orders, Tenma realizes he has been demoted.</p></font>

   <br>
    <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Publicly humiliated and with a 
career in tatters, Tenma falls further from grace. While Dr. Heinemann admires Tenma's abilities, he is resolute on punishing his 
insolence - adding further injury to Tenma's already crushed dreams by revealing that he's taken advantage of the idealistic and 
naïve young man's potential by commandeering his thesis research as his own without credit. Following this, Tenma's fiancé Eva 
refuses to provide an ounce of comfort or empathy. Instead, she simultaneously breaks off their engagement following this event, 
telling him how their relationship was shallow and purely devised for a social advantage, that she has no purpose being tied to 
a man with no future prospects, and that he was "such a fool" for believing him worthy of her or that her love for him was genuine.<p/>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Crestfallen, Tenma drives to the hospital and pays a visit to the young boy he saved. In 
his grief and frustration while believing himself alone, with none but the comatose body before him, he angrily voices his misery, 
even going as far as shouting out that the bastards who ruined his promising career would be better off dead. Truly, Tenma did not 
wish for their deaths, but released the sentiment in a moment of intense anger, presuming that this dark admission (which seems to 
startle himself the moment he utters it) would not be heard by nobody. Unbeknownst to him, the young boy, previously in a comatose 
state, had awakened yet remained silent and motionless, attentively focused on the proclamation of his savior.</p></font>

Heinemann, Doctor Boyer, and Doctor Oppenheim -- had all met untimely deaths the previous evening after consuming poisoned candy. 
In the midst of all the bustle, the young boy and his twin sister had also mysteriously disappeared from the hospital's grounds. 
At the director's funeral, Tenma is met by an officer of the BKA (the federal criminal police office of Germany), Heinrich Lunge, 
whom he had been informed was investigating the case. Lunge made the observation that the trio of deaths and the events which 
consequently occurred all seemed to be working in the favor of one man: Doctor Tenma.</p>
  <p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Due to a lack of evidence, the case received little attention. That is, until a major 
clue popped up in 1995.</p></font>

  <br>
  <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Tenma's life only improved from 
there; he was able to continue saving lives, but didn't have the burden of being Director Heinemann's whipping boy. As for Lunge, 
he pushed the case from his immediate consciousness and instead was focusing the murders of middle-aged couples throughout Germany. 
His investigations lead him to a</p></font>

  <br>
   <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">man -- Adolf Junkers -- whom he 
believed was affiliated with the killings (though as a lock pick instead of directly ending the couples' lives). Junkers, however, 
had received a head injury after being hit by a car and needed treatment from a top-notch neurosurgeon immediately. Of course, there 
was no man better suited for the task than Tenma, who followed through with the operation quickly and efficiently. In the process of 
recovery, Junkers was reluctant to speak of his involvement with the serial killings, but finally decided he was ready to confess 
one evening after receiving some encouraging words from Tenma. At that time, Tenma was going out on a date prearranged for him by 
Doctor Becker, one of his colleagues, but saw a certain clock in a shop window which reminded him of something he was told by Junkers, 
and he decided to purchase the item as a gift for his patient. Instead of waiting until morning arose, Tenma stood up his date and took 
the clock over the hospital immediately. Upon arrival, he was met with a rather unpleasant surprise.</p></font>

wrapper next to him. Appalled, Tenma burst into Junkers' room and saw from a window that his patient was running down the 
street. He chased after him into an old, abandoned building where he came into contact with a beautiful blonde man. The 
young man shot the doctor's patient dead, then confessed that he too had once received treatment from him. Johan Liebert, 
the young boy whose life Tenma saved over that of the mayor's, the child who disappeared the night of the director's death, 
was standing before him. "I'm glad I was able to help," he told Tenma as he admitted to killing his three superiors nine years 
ago. Tenma stood there in shock as Johan walked past him and out of the building, where he was observed by Eva.</p></font>

  <br>
   <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Tenma gave his testimony of the 
previous night's events to Lunge, who was certain the doctor's deposition was nothing more than a fairytale fabricated in his mind. 
Tenma then started performing his own investigations on Johan Liebert, but to no avail, as all leads dropped off when the boy just 
"mysteriously disappeared" from whatever town he was staying in. With the help of a blind old man however, he was able to gather 
some information on the boy's twin sister, and learned she was residing in Heidelberg.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Tenma realized that if Johan had once lived with the couple and his sister, there 
certainly would have been a newspaper article reporting his disappearance.</p></font>

  <br>
     <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Therefore, he paid a visit to 
the Heidelberg Post and was, with the help of Jacob Mauler, able to pinpoint the current location of the boy's twin Anna, who now 
went by the name of Nina Fortner, at the home of Christianne and Erich Fortner. After concluding that it would have been exactly 
ten years since Johan left his sister in the Fortners' care, the two men hurried to her home as fast as they could. When they arrived, 
the parents remarked that Nina was out meeting a "friend" at Heidelberg Castle, so Tenma took off to try and reach the girl before it 
was too late while Mauler stayed behind with the couple, intending to call the police.</p></font>

arrived back at the her home though, it was too late; the dead bodies of Mr. Mauler and the Fortners were already waiting for them. 
Two police officers who were secretly working undercover for Johan appeared and told Tenma and Nina and they would be taken to the 
station. While driving, Tenma realized these men claiming to be on the side of justice were actually the ones who bloodied their 
hands that evening, so he acted quickly and ultimately ended up jumping off a bridge with Nina in his arms. The two spent the next 
few days living in a shack, but when Tenma went into town and returned back Nina had left without him. Before leaving, she had written 
a nice letter and prepared a couple of sandwiches for him to eat.</p>

nights before (not by our protagonists -- they had only tied him up), and a necktie was found at the scene of the crime. Eva 
knew whose necktie it was; it was the very one she purchased for a certain Kenzo Tenma, but was offering to keep her mouth 
shut about who the tie belonged to if Tenma was willing to take her back. When he refused, Eva started screaming and calling 
him a murderer. After she revealed the identity of the tie's holder to Lunge, Tenma officially became a murder suspect. Luckily 
for him, by the time Lunge received the news he was already on the run.</p></font>

  <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">The bright young doctor who had 
dedicated his life to saving lives for over ten years now had a new goal in mind: there was a certain life he had to end. Before 
beginning his grand cat-and-mouse chase though, he first had to learn how to use a gun, so he spent some time living and training 
with Hugo Bernhardt. During this period, Tenma also brought forth a joyous union between Hugo and a young girl whose mother he 
killed years ago -- they had lived together for quite a while, but she never once smiled or spoke to him. By the time Tenma left, 
the two walked hand in hand like father and daughter.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">After he became proficient in his use of firearms, Tenma ventured to Frankfurt, where 
he was investigating the recent murder of the Springer couple. While walking through their estate, he came into contact Otto Heckel, 
a thief and con-man who was looking to see if there were any good pickings.</p> <p style="line-height:160%;" align="justify">
Unfortunately, the police arrived at that time and the two had to make a quick escape. They paid a visit to a man carrying a message

  <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Tenma his fate had already been 
decided. The individual killed himself right after. Heckel soon came to realize just who the man he'd spent the day with was -- 
Kenzo Tenma, a former surgeon now wanted for murder -- and thought the two could earn a couple bucks if they went according to 
his magnificent plan of making Tenma an underworld doctor. Although Tenma had no intention of permanently staying in such a 
position, he did treat and save the life of a terrorist. This interaction important to the storyline because it's when Tenma 
first starts to show significant moral development; the old Doctor Tenma would have saved the terrorist in a moment's notice, 
but the new one forced the man to think about the innocent civilians that died by his hand and made him repent before saving 
his life.</p></font>

  <br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Next, Tenma learned Johan was once 
enrolled in an institution called Kinderheim 511, a government-run East German orphanage that tried to shape the students enrolled 
into perfect soldiers. He also learned that in 1985,</p></font>

  <br>
  <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">something awful, horrible, and 
"unspeakable" happened there. While trying to uncover just what the horrendous secret was, he came across a man by the name of 
Hartmann who was once the director there. He talked about how brilliant and perfect Johan was even before enrolling, but before 
he got to the grand revelation of '85, the two were interrupted by Hartmann's adopted child Dieter. Tenma was surprised to see 
the boy, as he had run into him earlier that day and treated some of his wounds. They arranged for him to come back at another 
time and hear the whole story. A few visits later, Tenma realized that Hartmann's kind exterior was just a cover-up for the fact 
that he had been been abusing Dieter. Next, Tenma decided to add kidnapping to his string of crimes and took the boy to a local 
hospital. He told the nurses he'd be back in a few hours and not to let anyone -- under any circumstances -- take Dieter unless 
it was him.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Tenma paid a visit to another orphanage that had been running for quite a while. He 
first tried to make arrangements for Dieter to move into it, but was unsuccessful.</p></font>

  <br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Afterwards, he and the caretaker, 
Erna Tietze, began talking about Kinderheim 511. It turned out that the orphanage he was currently visiting was the one Nina, or 
Anna at the time, stayed at while her brother was in Kinderheim. As for Kinderheim's secret, it was revealed that Johan manipulated 
all the staff and students to massacre each other, leaving alive only him and Christoph Sievernich. From there, he and his sister 
were adopted by the Lieberts and stayed with the family until that fateful day in April 1986.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">After that, he decided to go pick up Dieter, but was surprised to hear Hartmann had 
already come and gone. He found the two in Kinderheim's ruins; Dieter in a tall, royal-like chair and Hartmann standing right 
behind him in a rather psychotic state. In the end, Tenma managed to convince Dieter to leave Hartmann for good and join him on 
his journey. Next, the two travelled to a small village where they met Petra and Schumann; Tenma tried to leave</p></font>

Neo-Nazi group's plan to burn down the Turkish district of Frankfurt. Tenma ended up being captured by the group and Dieter ran 
to the city to warn the people of what was to come. After some cruel treatment, the former doctor met Helmut Wolf, a man who one 
might say is "close" to Johan -- he found the twins starving and half dead on the Czech-German border when they were about seven 
or eight and saved their lives; in return, Johan had been kind enough to ruin Wolf's, killing any person who ever knew him by 
name. You could say he and Tenma were almost in the same position, except that because Wolf had transformed into a withered husk 
as a result of his age, he was rendered useless when it came to killing Johan and instead asked of Tenma to do so.</p></font>

After, he was met with a nice message left by Johan on the top of a water tower about how the "monster inside of him is about to 
explode." Tenma received several other notes from Johan and consequently decided to get the input of Rudy Gillen, a former classmate 
of his and now a forensic psychologist, on what the messages might mean. Gillen first suspected that Tenma was in fact a serial killer 
himself and was suffering from dissociative identity disorder, but after a couple discussions with prison inmate Peter Jürgens it became 
apparent to him that Johan actually existed. Following that, he helped Tenma to escape from the police, who Gillen had called before 
realizing his friend's innocence.</p>

(Tenma arrived after he and Dieter hitched a ride with a British couple). Both men came to the same conclusion -- well, sort

feeling at the crime scene. Unlucky timing caused the two of them to meet face-to-face, and Tenma would have been caught had the 
real killer not shown up and wounded Lunge. In the end, Lunge's persistence caused him to almost bleed to death but Tenma saved

his weekly bird walks with Schuwald, a businessman he had recently become the secretary of, but came into contact with a former 
soldier who told him a regrettable story of his past then assured the birds around him that blood would never be shed again in 
the forest. Because of Tenma's compassionate heart, that conversation meant he could never bring himself to shoot Johan there.

had a conversation afterwards which confirmed his suspicions about whether or not Johan was involved. Following that he snuck 
into the University of Munich library with hopes of killing Johan at Schuwald's book donation ceremony the following day. Overnight, 
he had recollections of his own childhood.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Unfortunately for Tenma, his scheme to execute Johan did not follow through exactly as

consolation, Tenma ended up shooting someone for the first time; he was faced with a "kill or be killed" situation between 
himself and Roberto, and shot the unlucky hit man off the library's balcony onto the floor, seemingly killing him. After, 
he shot off the doors' hinges, freeing all of the flames' captives. Instead of filing out with the others though, Tenma 
re-entered the burning landscape in yet another attempt to end the young man's life. As always, he met some sort of road 
block -- this time it was Nina, who insisted that he mustn't shoot. He too made the same proclamation when she tried to 
kill her brother. In the end, Nina became trapped under a burning curtain and Johan escaped while Tenma saved his sister.

Prague, while coincidentally Johan, Lunge, Nina, and Dieter were also heading in that direction (none of the parties came into 
contact though). While he was on a train, he met a "freelance journalist" known as Wolfgang Grimmer. The two talked a bit, and 
Grimmer realized Tenma's discomfort when the police were checking his passport -- which was actually fake -- so he created a 
diversion which made it easy for the former doctor to secretly jump off the train. Grimmer joined him not long after and gave 
him tips on how to secretly cross the Czech-German border without being seen by the patrol officers. The two then parted ways, 
not knowing how closely related their separate reasons for coming to Prague really were. Tenma successfully crossed the border 
and began digging up as much information about the twins' mother and her history as he could. At the same time, Grimmer and Jan 
Suk were struggling with the secret police and Suk ended up in a position which mirrored the situation Tenma dealt with in '86:

so much conflict was merely that there were many groups of people who wanted a tape containing a drugged interrogation with a 
certain little boy who sent Kinderheim 511 into ruin. Tenma knew that the whole situation was somehow related to Johan, and 
decided it would be best to find Suk as soon as possible. He paid a visit to the detective's mother, a woman suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease, in the hospital. She mistook the middle-aged Japanese man for her son as a child, and started teasing 
him about how she knew where his secret hideout was. When he learned of Suk's little hiding spot, he figured that was at least 
a starting point to search for the detective. Upon arrival, he was faced with many injured and deceased members of the secret 
police, a screaming Suk, and a smiling Grimmer with blood dripping from his hands.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Grimmer explained to Tenma the situation and everything that had been happening to

to the doctor that he was once an inmate of Kinderheim 511 and had consequently developed an alternative personality, "The 
Magnificent Steiner," who shows up in stressful situations and fights with a superhuman, beast-like power. Later, the two 
men met with Karel Ranke, the former head of the Czech Secret Police who offered to them the safe return of Suk (currently 
in one of his organization's hospitals) in exchange for the tape. They agreed with the condition that the three of them 
listen to it first. The group collected the tape from its secure location in the hands of Suk's mother, but when they got 
to a certain point a voice had taped over the material, leaving a message for Tenma instead. Johan had gotten there first.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">After the young detective's release, Tenma and Grimmer split ways. From there, Tenma 
stopped by the home of Tomas Zobak who was the former editor of picture book author Franz Bonaparta, a man Tenma's investigations 
revealed to be a very important figure in the twins' lives. Right after Tenma left, Zobak called the police and he was arrested 
within minutes.</p></font>

the police station, he whispered that the hardest people to interrogate are the ones who say nothing at all. Tenma took his advice 
and it proved to be successful. Ultimately, Fritz Verdemann and Alfred Baul were hired to represent him in court. Verdemann was a 
top-notch lawyer known throughout Germany, and Baul was supposedly another legal expert. However, upon meeting with Tenma during a 
prison consultation, Baul turned out to be Roberto, who had actually survived the events at the library. "Baul" told Tenma that he

the man told him his story of how he met and saved the twins before passing on. Following that slight interruption, Tenma went 
back to his main priority: to find Eva and make sure she was safe, which lead him to Martin Reest. Martin had connections with 
The Baby and Petr Čapek (two of the Neo-Nazis from the group he ran into in Frankfurt earlier), and was acting as Eva's bodyguard 
for an unprecedented amount of time, having apparently retrieved her from her hotel room before Roberto as "Baul" could get to her. 
After he tried to run away with her, he was mortally shot and in his dying moments told Tenma about Capek's plan in addition to the 
fact that Eva could be found at Frankfurt Central Station. Tenma visited the woman, told her Martin was dead, then waited alongside

  <br>
      <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Tenma is a workaholic who 
prioritizes his patients and their well-being more than anything. Although he's a highly skilled neurosurgeon, he confesses to 
Inspector Lunge that during a surgery he's jumping out of his skin due to the fright of committing a mistake.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Tenma is often obsessed with saving as many lives as he can. Johan enjoys toying 
with this mindset, sprouting several massacres possibly to challenge Tenma to prevent them.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">His kindness is prevalent throughout the series - in contrast to Johan's unscrupulous 
nature - and he sometimes ponders about the moral of his actions. When he is worried (often with Johan) he neglects his own self 
care and goes as far as collapsing for lack of food or sleep. Other than that, he's overall an optimistic individual, or tries his 
best to seem so to others, giving words of encouragement to the people around him.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">When Lunge enters Tenma's psyche he discovers that Tenma doesn't fit in either Japanese 
or German society. Nevertheless, Tenma isn't too unsociable, and ironically in several flashbacks (Eva's and Rudi's) he is seen 
happily hanging around in a group. He does prefer to work alone rather than in a team if he can help it though.</p></font>

 <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Tenma's motto and the reason he 
disobeyed Director Heinemann's orders to save the person who arrived first regardless of social status. This ideal is not just 
a matter of work ethic, much of Tenma's psychology stems from this principle, and it is one of the reasons he struggles so much 
with his own decision of killing Johan. For instance, Tenma becomes wracked with guilt at shooting Roberto in spite of the 
apparent necessity of his actions, believing that he had killed the man, and expresses such great remorse over his seeming 
death that he feels himself unworthy of being called a doctor. There is even a personality shift when Tenma starts to doubt 
his own belief.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Many close friends of Tenma interviewed in Another Monster, including Eva, mention 
the reason they love to be around Tenma is that he never looks down on them, and regardless of his exceptional skills, he treats 
others as equals or puts more value in their abilities over his own.</p></font>

her marriage with Tenma after discovering he disobeyed the hospital director's orders. In Another Monster, she explains that 
she did so because her father needed a right-hand man in whom he could put his full trust, but still emphasizes that breaking 
the engagement was her own conscious decision.</p>

ignores him. Yet, when Tenma gets to be the head of the surgery department again, their roles are reversed, and Tenma ignores 
Eva's pleas to get back together. Later, Eva goes as far as falsely accusing Tenma of murder and chases him to make him regret 
not wanting her back.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Tenma still cares for Eva deeply, despite the cruel way she broke off the engagement

<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">In his early childhood, Tenma tried to make friends by clinging to his kid neighbors so 
they could play with him. The two bullied Tenma in return, and gave him the nickname “Sissy Pants Tenma” as a cruel mockery. Despite 
that, Tenma earned their respect after a game of hide-and-seek; the bullies ran home during the game on purpose so that Tenma would 
be left hiding alone. After hours passed by, his mom called asking for the whereabouts of her son. The two got extremely worried and 
went looking for him, and they found out he was still waiting in the same place that whole time. Amazed by his endurance, the two 
genuinely became his friends.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">In middle school, a teacher went too far with his punishment and humiliated one of 
his classmates in front of the class for playing with a coal heater. Tenma stood up for that classmate to protect him from being 
further mistreated.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">During his teenage years, Tenma loved music. He learned how to play guitar but didn't 
join a band, maybe because he didn't want to be in a group. His all time favorite song is Let's Stay Together by Al Green. His 
talent for music eventually became dormant as he got very busy with his studies. He also participated in the school's track and 
field club.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">He entered one of the best schools in Kanagawa prefecture. His path was pretty much 
set in stone by his father at this time: he would inherit the Hospital and become its new director. Despite being his younger son, 
his father found his brilliant scores far superior to his older brothers'. This upset Tenma in some way, thus, he refused to accept 
his father's request.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">His eight year older brother opted for a career in Economy, so appointing him as a 
hospital director was out of question. His two older year brother, however, was following in his father's footsteps, but it took 
him two years to enter a medical school and his university was much less prestigious than Tenma's. Still, Tenma wanted his middle 
brother to be the new director. Tenma's mother agreed with his choice because it benefited her less talented stepson (the novel 
mentions she favored her stepchildren over her own biological son with no given reason), but Tenma's father didn't change his mind. 
Tenma was going to be forced to inherit the Hospital whether he wanted it or not.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">What saved Tenma from this headache was an outstanding thesis by a German medical 
professor at Dusseldorf University named Udo Heinemann. The thesis, printed in a medical journal, was a paper on the care of 
Alzheimer's disease victims. Tenma made up his mind on a whim that he would leave Japan and study under Heinemann, forcing his 
father to give the Hospital to his brother.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Using his scholarship fund, he went to Düsseldorf University in Germany and spent a 
year in a language school to clear the requirements to enter into med school. Then, he graduated and specialized himself in 
neurosurgery, and finally, he found a job in Eisler Memorial Hospital whose director was Dr. Heinemann.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">But this decision that seemed good at first backfired. Tenma's middle brother decided 
to provide health care to small towns instead. To this day, he sends letters pleading Tenma to come back to Japan and take over the 
hospital.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">And Dr. Heinemann, the brilliant professor, didn't write the article Tenma loved, a 
ghost-writer did, and Tenma was fated to become one of them too.</p>

  <br>
  <font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Main article: Another Monster 
Werner Weber tried to interview him to have his account on the events surrounding Johan. The second chapter of Another Monster 
materialized through Werner's efforts on interviewing people who have known Dr. Tenma.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">This second chapter went straight ahead with facts on him: He was born 2nd of January 
1958, in Yokohama in Kanagawa Prefecture. His father was a director and manager of a city-owned hospital and his mother a former 
editor for a medical publisher. Both were divorced and they had Dr. Tenma after the first year of their marriage. It is also 
revealed here that Dr. Tenma had two older half-brothers.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Weber hired an interpreter to help him get around and he also tried to secure an 
interview with the hospital his father managed with no avail. He learned that Dr. Tenma kept in touch with very few of his friends, 
and those willing to assist weber in his investigation declined upon knowing that he was a foreigner. Weber also confirmed Inspector 
Lunge's assessment of Dr. Tenma that he does not fit in the Japanese society nor is he culturally German--he is stranger to both 
cultures</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Weber had, eventually, been able to interview one of Dr. Tenma's friends back in 
elementary and high school. That friend of Dr. Tenma was still living in near the Tenma household. When interviewed by Weber, 
he was very much surprised that his friend was linked to a series of murders, because back when they were young, he was that 
kind of student who was very diligent and hard working. He also described Tenma to be very accommodating, despite his 'rich boy' 
status. He told Weber that Dr. Tenma liked sports, but team sports did not interest him. He was very good at solo sports though.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Weber asked him what he remembers about Dr. Tenma in their childhood. He said he used 
to bully Dr. Tenma together with older brother that one time, they had come up with an idea to scare the young Tenma off. They asked 
him if he should like to play hide-and-seek with them. The young Tenma consented, and he was made the 'it'. Now, they really did not 
ide, but left young Tenma there in the woods for half an hour until they decided to get him back because it was creepy back there. 
The young Tenma actually peed in his pants because of panicking that he was left alone. His friends started calling him names, but 
he did not cry with that. The next time they asked Tenma to play hide-and-seek again, he thought Tenma would not fall for the same 
trick again, but Tenma again consented and played. This time however, they left him there for forty minutes. When they tried to look 
for him after that, they couldn't find him, so they concluded that Tenma had already gone home. Later Dr. Tenma's mother called them, 
asking whether they are still with Kenzo, so they went back on their play place and saw Tenma there, saying "No fair, I've been hiding 
the whole time!". After that incident they stopped picking him and they started being friends. That friend of Dr. Tenma concluded after 
this incident that Dr. Tenma was always hardest on himself.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">In seventh grade, Tenma tried to play with the coal heater, heating it up until the metal 
pokers bend and twist. Their teacher, who was so used at employing corporal punishment to discipline her children, asked who did it. 
Tenma spoke up and he was scolded and hit. But he said nothing for that matter. However, when another classmate of his played with the 
heater, his teacher scolded him and even pointed the hot metal poker on that student's neck. This made Tenma stand and he said tot he 
teacher, "You can't do that, it's too cruel. If you think this is education, I'll tell the principal and the Board of Education." Those 
words scared the teacher away.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Weber was able to interview another friend of Tenma who was a commercial film director. 
He described Tenma as a 'straight-A' student in his eighth and ninth grade. Although being on the top of the class, he was not singled 
out and got along with everyone for the most part. When Weber asked him if he believes Dr. Tenma is a serial killer, he said it was 
because of this question that he is reluctant to agree in this interview. He firmly believed Dr. Tenma cannot be a murderer. But then 
again. people don't always stay the same, and because the German government treats it like it is a big deal, there's a possibility 
that it is true. He also said he was not able to call Dr. Tenma and check on him because he himself is struggling whether or not to 
believe in Dr. Tenma's innocence. When asked about Tenma's preoccupations in middle school, he said Tenma was a good guitar player 
and even said that Tenma was multi-talented. Tenma, he says, was very quick on appreciating other people's abilities and belittles 
his own talents even though he has his own innate talents. He also said that Dr. Tenma did not like being in a group altogether, 
thereby getting at a consensus with the previous interviewee's statement. When asked about the music Dr. Tenma liked, the film 
director said the he [Tenma], liked this one laid-back song he saw from the from Tokyo Music Festival on TV, but he forgot the 
title of the song.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">The third person Weber had interviewed was one of Dr. Tenma's high school friends who 
was now a section chief of a large trading company. He said he was friends with Dr. Tenma through high school, but after entering 
college, they kind of lost touch with each other because of Dr. Tenma's medical classes and him being at Law School enjoying his 
college life. He firmly stated that he was one of the people in constant contact with Dr. Tenma before he moved to Germany. When 
asked if he believed Dr. Tenma was guilty of the crimes pinned on him, he said he used to make a lot of jokes about it in front of 
their friends but deep inside he was worrying about him. He said Tenma was introverted, with not much time on girls and lovelife. 
After setting parties for him to know more women, no one interested him. There was even a time when Tenma was asked by one of her 
friends about love problems. That girl actually fell for Tenma, but Tenma did not reciprocate the girl's feelings and tried to uplift 
his male friend's image to that girl.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">When this friend of Dr. Tenma was asked if he anything why Dr. Tenma flew to Germany, his 
friend recounted these events: While Dr. Tenma had two older half brothers, his eldest brother, eight years older than him, had an 
inclination to the liberal arts and pursued an economic degree. This made their father hesitant to leave the family business to his 
eldest son as customary. His father's second son was into medicine, but failed to pass the entrance exam in Kenzo's college. He was 
able to enter another school however, but its calibre and prestige is way below Kenzo's so their father was firm on his statement 
that Dr. Tenma should inherit their family business. Dr. Tenma did not want the handle it, and he was afraid it will be forced on 
him. Surprisingly his won mother supported the idea that the second son should manage the business. It can also be noted that Dr. 
Tenma's mother was very hard on him compared to the sons of his husband.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">When Dr. Tenma found Dr. Udo Heinemann's research on Alzheimer's disease, the young 
college man decided to fly to Germany, to study under the tutelage of the said researcher and also, to escape his father's strong 
grasp on him. Of course this made his father angry, said Dr. Tenma's friend, but Dr. Tenma did not request for any money and spent 
his scholarship fund during the length of his studies in Düsseldorf University. Dr. Tenma went to a language school for about a year 
and then went off to enrolling for medical school. He had exemplary marks on his studies and found employment in Eisler Memorial 
Hospital. He later learned that Dr. Heinemann's researches were not actually written by him, but by his teaching assistants. Dr. 
Tenma feared that he might become one of them.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Dr. Tenma, is one of the few people who possessed the traits of a good surgeon: careful 
judgment and instant decision-making.</p></font>
