<font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify"><b>Johan Liebert</b> (Yohan Riberuto) 
is the titular "monster" and main antagonist of the series. He is the older twin brother of Nina Fortner (formerly known as Anna 
Liebert) who was shot in the head in 1986, but he was operated on and saved from death by Dr. Kenzo Tenma. Because of this, he is 
very grateful to Dr. Tenma and extends a profound respect towards his savior throughout the series.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">He has spent portions of his life in different locations under different aliases and 
possesses an extraordinary level of charisma and intelligence. He tends to use his gifts to cruelly manipulate and corrupt others, 
often with no apparent end other than to cause suffering and destruction for his pleasure. His original goal, as he states when he is 
young, was to be the last one standing at the end of the world, though later he decides upon a different fate toward the height of this 
pursuit, to erase himself from the world and commit the perfect suicide.</p></font>

      <hr size="1" color="yellow">
      <font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Johan is a handsome young man who 
has often been described as "beautiful" (by various characters) with short blonde hair that has bangs hanging on either side, blue eyes
and his skin appears to be a very pale skin color.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">As a child, he had short bangs hanging over his forehead.</p></font>

     <summary><b>Personality</b></summary>
      <hr size="1" color="yellow">
    <font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">On the surface, Johan is a 
well-mannered, charismatic, and compassionate yet somewhat aloof young man who possesses a myriad of favorable traits and can easily 
overwhelm individuals with his seemingly flawless nature, as seen with Hans Georg Schuwald, who describes him as being not of this 
world. This meticulously crafted facade makes it easy for him to make new allies and manipulate them into doing various deeds for 
him through the influence of his supposed friendship and good will. With such skill in creating this sense of perfection and pureness, 
Johan hides his true motives with ease.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Within this contrived exterior, however, Johan callously delivers destruction and 
suffering to those who happen to fall prey to his schemes. Even before his tenure at Kinderheim 511, Johan still exhibits psychopathic 
tendencies. For example, most of his murders, both in childhood and adulthood, have been premeditated and calculated.</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="Images01/1648308944275.png"><img src="Images01/1648308944275.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:violet;"><p align="center">Johan often shows a complete disregard for life by pointing to his 
forehead, inviting Dr. Kenzo Tenma to shoot him</p></font>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Many of Johan's beliefs run consistent 
with nihilism, as he does not see any meaning to life. He claims, "Most of this universe is 'death' anyway," and that to the universe, 
"most lives are just specks in a corner of the earth, gone in a flash".</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Johan also has a tendency to make his victims experience the worst possible loss and 
suffering rather than actually killing them himself; this experience often leads the victims to kill themselves, however. Helmut Wolf 
is a prime example of this; instead of simply being killed, Wolf is forced to watch as all of his close relatives and acquaintances 
die, one after another, all so he can feel what Johan felt, solitude.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">The root of Johan's actions is unknown. Although he was sent to the experimental orphanage
of Kinderheim 511, Hartmann informs Tenma that, "[Kinderheim 511] couldn't possibly create a masterpiece like him!" Neither of his 
parents seemed to suffer from psychopathy or any other mental illnesses. Anna, despite being the twin to experience the horrible events 
at the Red Rose Mansion, turns out to be a genuinely loving and caring person. However, while she is able to suppress her memories of 
the Red Rose Mansion, Johan takes them as his own, coming to believe that he was the one who experienced them. After the Ruhenheim 
massacre, while convalescing in a state hospital from his second operation, Johan reveals to Tenma, through unknown means, his memory 
of his mother's decision, revealing that the memory affected him profoundly.</p></font>

<font style="font-size: 20px;color:violet;"><p align="center">As children, Johan and Anna are vaunted as beautiful jewels destined 
to lead humanity.</p></font>
<br>
 <font style="font-size: 20px; color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Johan Liebert and his twin sister, 
Anna, were born as the result of a eugenics experiment orchestrated by Franz Bonaparta, the primary goal of which was to create a child 
who had not only an exceptionally high level of intelligence and a flawless appearance, but who could also lead the human race.</p>
<p align="justify">After Johan's mother, Viera Černá, is released from confinement, she and the twins move into the Three Frogs Building 
next to Cedok Bridge in Prague. Cerna dresses both of her children as identical girls to make it appear as though she has a single child, 
rather than twins. The family leads a very quiet life, and most of their neighbors hardly take notice of them.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">In 1981, Franz Bonaparta and his then-assistant Petr Čapek appear before the family to 
inform them that one of the twins will be taken to the Red Rose Mansion for experimentation; the other will stay at home. Bonaparta 
stages the situation such that Cerna is the one who has to make the decision of which twin to give away. At first, she hands over Johan, 
but quickly changes her mind and gives up Anna instead. It is unknown whether or not she is aware which child is which. This event
impacts Johan for the rest of his life, leaving him to question whether his mother was trying to protect him or had confused him for 
Anna.</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="Images01/1648308953891.png"><img src="Images01/1648308953891.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:violet;"><p align="center">Johan requests that Anna tell him of her experience at the Red Rose 
Mansion.</p></font>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Anna and Cerna are both taken away, 
and Johan stays at the Three Frogs by himself. Alone, he spends time reading The Nameless Monster, a picture book written and 
illustrated by Franz Bonaparta under the pen name Emil Scherbe. When Anna escapes from the Red Rose Mansion and returns to the 
Three Frogs, Johan asks her to describe the experience. Eventually, Johan confuses the information relayed by his sister for his 
own experiences, and comes to believe that he was the one who suffered through the events at the Red Rose Mansion.</p>

<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">An individual visits and informs the twins that they will have to live on their own. Johan 
and Anna then burn down the Three Frogs and run away, directionless with no destination in mind. Sometime later, the twins meet a 
middle-aged couple who give them sandwiches and contemplate taking them into their care. While playing in a field of grass in front 
of the couple, Johan tells Anna that he has a plan: to kill their new caretakers and subsequently wander directionless once again.

<font style="font-size: 20px;color:violet;"><p align="center">While crossing the Czech-German border with no destination in mind, 
Johan and his sister collapse from exhaustion.</p></font>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">On their journey, Johan and Anna in 
time pass out from exhaustion in the mountains by the Czech-German border. A patrol officer named Helmut Wolf rescues them from their 
near-death experience. He looks in Johan's bag and finds only one thing: a copy of The Nameless Monster. He decides to name the boy 
Johan after the monster in the book, and gives the girl the name Anna. Afterwards, he sends them to two separate orphanages: Anna 
to a place called Orphanage 47 and Johan to Kinderheim 511.</p></font>
<br>
  <left><font style="font-size: 30px;color:orange;"><b>Kinderheim 511 massacre</b></font></left>
  <br>
  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Kinderheim 511 was a secret, East 
German experimental orphanage located in East Berlin, with the goal of creating perfect soldiers. When Johan arrives at Kinderheim 511, 
he is said to have already been beyond their program, naturally arousing the curiosity of the higher-ups and leading to a forced 
interview while under the effects of chemical treatment.</p></font>
  <br>

  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:violet;"><p align="center">From atop a staircase in his chair, Johan contently gazes at 
Kinderheim 511's destruction.</p></font>
  <br>
  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">In time, Johan no longer desires to 
be at the orphanage. To escape, he formulates a plan: He will take advantage of the tension within the orphanage, or "[throw] a scrap 
of cloth doused in oil onto an open flame" as he puts it, by capitalizing on the hatred born when people come together. This eventually 
leads to the chaotic event that forever taints the reputation of Kinderheim 511. Fifty children and instructors fight and kill each other,
all while Johan simply sits in a chair at the top of the main staircase, watching calmly as the massacre ensues and the orphanage burns.
</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">After the massacre is over, Johan finds and saves a hungry and parched Christof Sievernich, 
with whom he formulates a plan and decides to reunite with roughly ten years later.</p></font>

and Anna.</p></font>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Johan and Anna are then adopted by 
former East German foreign trade advisor Michael Liebert and his wife. Originally, the Lieberts only want to adopt Johan. He, however, 
refuses to go anywhere without his sister, so Anna too is adopted and given a place within the family. In April 1986, the four flee to 
West Germany, specifically to the city of Dusseldorf.</p></font>

  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:violet;"><p align="center">Johan instructs Anna to shoot him in the head after he has killed the 
Lieberts.</p></font>
 <br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Franz Bonaparta, who is living in 
the south German town of Ruhenheim under the name Klaus Poppe, sees the twins on TV and decides to pay them a visit. The Lieberts 
allow him in, and he looks at twins while under the impression that they are sleeping. Johan, however, is not asleep and thinks 
that Franz Bonaparta, whom he has coined a "monster," is going to seize hold of him and his sister again, supported by his later 
statement, "A monster came today... A monster came to take the two of us away." He consequently kills the Lieberts. The gunshots 
wake Anna, and she finds her parents' corpses as well as Johan standing armed in a nearby room. He gives Anna the gun, then orders 
her to shoot him in the head, wipe the gun after, and throw it out of the window. She follows through with Johan's request and pulls 
the trigger, subsequently entering a state of shock herself. The neighbors, who have woke up due to all of the gunshots, call the 
police. The authorities arrive shortly after and Johan, in critical condition at the time, is sent to Eisler Memorial Hospital to 
be operated on by Dr. Kenzo Tenma.</p></font>

  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:violet;"><p align="center">Johan is operated on and saved by Dr. Kenzo Tenma.</p></font>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">As Dr. Tenma is just about to 
begin surgery on Johan, he is contacted by the Eisler Memorial Hospital director, Udo Heinemann, who demands that he remove himself 
from the boy's operation and attend to Mayor Roedecker instead. After thinking of a similar previous incident he had regretted, 
Tenma ultimately decides to operate on Johan. Although Johan's surgery is successful, Tenma's decision to operate on him instead 
of Mayor Roedecker results in the latter's death. His decision also consequently leads to him being punished: He is stripped of 
his position and has any chances of career progress ruined.</p></font>

  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:violet;"><p align="center">Angered by being stripped of his position, Dr. Tenma visits a 
convalescing Johan to vent his frustration.</p></font>
  <br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Filled with rage, Tenma approaches 
a presumably unconscious Johan to vent his anger. Proclaiming that he was not wrong and that Udo Heinemann is not a doctor, but 
rather a filthy money-mongerer, the angered surgeon wishes death upon the Eisler Memorial director. Unbeknownst to him, Johan is 
not only conscious, but also very grateful for Tenma's decision. As a result, Johan, using poisoned candy, decides to repay his 
debt by granting Tenma his wish: He kills Udo Heinemann, along with Dr. Oppenheim and Dr. Boyer, then disappears from the hospital 
with Anna.</p></font>

  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:violet;"><p align="center">Johan saves Rheinhard Dinger from arrest. Dinger expresses his 
gratitude by allowing Johan and Anna to stay at his apartment for a few days.</p></font>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">On the same day that they escape 
from Eisler Memorial Hospital, Johan and Anna run into Rheinhard Dinger, who has come into trouble with the authorities for attacking 
a man. Johan tells the police that Dinger isn't in the wrong, and that the abuser had attacked him first, saving him from potential 
jail time. Out of gratitude, Dinger offers to drive Johan and Anna to their home, but, after discovering they have no home, allows 
the two to stay at his apartment for a couple of days. Johan, Anna, and Dinger watch the news while eating dinner. When Dinger mutters 
to himself about how depraved the world is and how "the scum should all die," Johan agrees with his notion, stating, "We don't need... 
those people," a comment that marks the start of Dinger's career as a murderer.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Sometime later, the siblings travel to Heidelberg, where Johan leaves his amnesia-stricken 
sister in the care of the Fortners until 1995. Then, he goes to Munich and stays with a family under the name Franz Heineau from March 
of 1987 to April of 1988, where he strikes up a good relationship with a blind man and former soldier. The veteran tells Johan war 
stories and, per his request, gives him his personal description of "ultimate fear." He also teaches Johan French and English, which 
he masters by the end of the thirteen-month period. Johan then stays with the Reichmanns in Koln for a year, the Schumanns in Hanover, 
a couple in Hamburg, and possibly Hanna Kemp.</p></font>

Lieberts' deceased son, Johan Wilhelm Liebert.</p></font>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Next, Johan goes to Bruntal, where 
he finds a new couple with the last name "Liebert." Coincidentally, they once had a son named Johan who died as a toddler, which 
gives Johan the opportunity to jump into the deceased boy's identity. Following a convenient fire where the town's birth certificates 
are kept, the Lieberts are able to apply for a new application making it seem as though their son never died. Johan provides his new 
family with a nice home in Offenbach Hessen.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Johan uses the couple to prove he has an identity and ordinary background. Although he 
has established a family, however, he doesn't spend much time with them. At the age of fifteen, Johan organizes a money laundering 
business which becomes very prosperous and well-known in the German underworld. Towards the end of his career, he spends several 
months living with Halenka Novakova, who is baffled by the extraordinary similarities between Johan and her friend Viera Černá. 
Novakova is the victim of a phantom killing in 1995, presumably related to her association with Johan. Eventually Johan grows 
bored of the underground bank, so he takes an amount of money and abandons it. With the president's disappearance and an inevitable 
end in sight, those involved lose control, wiping away what is left of the organization with a massacre.</p></font>

  <br>
  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">From 1993 until he abandons the 
bank, Johan begins hiring serial killers around Germany to murder his former foster parents. One trio carrying out the executions

two are killed on the spot and Junkers is hit by a car after trying to run away, sustaining an injury to the head. He receives 
treatment from Kenzo Tenma and makes a miraculous recovery, until one night his paranoia causes him to run out of the hospital 
in terror. Tenma chases after him and they reach an abandoned building. There, Junkers is shot to death by Johan, leaving Tenma 
severely shocked. As Johan leaves the premises, he is observed by Eva Heinemann.</p></font>

sister, who now goes by the name of Nina, from Heidelberg in May 1995. He begins to interact with her anonymously via email, and 
informs her that he is going to pick up her soon. He later monitors her as she meets with a young man named Otto Huberman, whom 
she believes to be the anonymous sender. Nina, after spotting Johan's figure in the crowd from afar, begins questioning who he is 
and subsequently faints.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Later, Johan sends Nina a message requesting that she meet him at Heidelberg Castle. 
He hires two corrupt cops, Detective Messener and Michael Muller, to kill the Fortners while Nina is out. He also pays a gardener 
at the castle to make sure she doesn't leave the premises, as he has something to do before he can arrive himself. Dr. Tenma later

begins to target an organization led by neo-Nazi leaders "the Baby", Professor Gunther Goedelitz, Petr Capek, and Helmut Wolf, 
who believe that he will become the next Adolf Hitler. Tenma, meanwhile, arrives in Frankfurt investigating the murder of the 
Springers, a family Johan stays with under the name Erich before arranging to have them killed by unnamed man.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Johan annihilates Goedelitz and his henchmen and leaves Nina a message telling her to 
meet him at the ruins of the Hilden & Engels warehouse in Romberg. He then leaves a message for Tenma on a water tower that reads 
"Hilfe! Das Monstrus in mir wird explodieren!" After these events, Johan leaves to pose as a law student at the University of

university is to get close to the former business tycoon Hans Georg Schuwald. In his initial scheme, Johan intends for Schuwald 
to ultimately end up dead, which will then allow him to gain control over Germany's economy. First, he manipulates murderers to 
kill those close to Schuwald, creating an empty space he can fill with himself as one of the elder's Latin readers.</p>

offers the teetotaling detective a drink.</p></font>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:160%;" align="justify">Private detective Richard Brown is 
hired to investigate the case of Fahren's suicide, and, after suspecting Johan, begins to draw connections between Johan and other 
unsolved murders. In retaliation to Richard's meddling, Johan meets with and takes him to a bar. There, masked as research for his 
college thesis, he begins mentioning how Richard executed a seventeen-year-old serial rapist and murderer named Stefan Jost while 
supposedly drunk. In conjunction with stating various sections from the on the Rights of the Child, which put the detective in the 
wrong, Johan is able to rile up Richard and suggests that the two go on a walk for some fresh air, taking with him a bottle of whiskey. 
The two eventually make it to the top of a building roof, where Johan reveals that he knew Richard wasn't actually drunk when he shot 
and killed Stefan Jost, rather that he was sober. He further provokes Richard by questioning how his daughter, whom he is supposed to 
see the next day for the first time in years, would feel about this information. After this revelation, Johan offers a then-anxious 
Richard the bottle of whiskey he took from the bar. Richard is found dead the next morning.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Meanwhile, Johan is able to reunite Schuwald with his long-lost son; delighted, Schuwald 
makes Johan his newly-appointed secretary. Karl and Schuwald decide that because Johan has a broad understanding of economics, if 
anything were to happen to Schuwald he would occupy his position instead of Karl. Johan's plan had run smoothly up until that point, 
and all he had to do was ensure Schuwald's death at the book donation ceremony (which would be carried out by Roberto).</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">While previewing the collection of books Schuwald is donating to the Munich University 
Library, Johan, on a sudden urge, wanders off and finds a copy of The Nameless Monster. Examining the picture book's contents triggers 
a sudden psychological reaction in him, which causes him to shriek and cry in agony. He is then admitted into a hospital and leaves 
the next morning. In Another Monster, it is suggested that after Johan encounters The Nameless Monster, he abandons his plans with 
both Schuwald and Sievernich, and his focus shifts to uncovering his past.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">At Schuwald's mansion, Johan is given a letter by Karl sent to him from the "Red 
Hindenburg," whom he knows to be Blue Sophie. Blue Sophie has been posing as Margot Langer (Halenka Novakova, Schuwald's former 
lover), and met Johan when he visited her with Edmund Fahren. Johan knows the purpose of the letter: Sophie has been attempting 
to blackmail him in hopes of getting hush money for his connection to the deaths of Fahren and several others. As a counter to 
this, Johan has had Roberto form a relationship with Sophie in order to obtain her trust before going to meet her himself. He 
goes to the red-light district where she is located and converses with her. She informs him of the various things she knows, 
ranging from his real name not being "Johan Liebert" to his scheme to kill Schuwald, threatening that if he is to leave, her 
"boyfriend" behind the door will come out and shoot him. In response, Johan asks her what she thinks to be the most frightening 
thing, and follows up by stating, "I thought I had gotten to the darkest place in the world... but then... ahead of me... I saw 
an even darker blackness." Claiming to be done with Sophie, he begins to leave the premises, revealing that he is no longer 
interested in Schuwald. To this, Sophie orders her boyfriend Roberto to come out, who, unbeknownst to her, is Johan's right-hand 
man. As Johan leaves the premises, Roberto kills the prostitute.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">On the day of Schuwald's book donation ceremony, Johan prepares to burn down the 
ceremonial room and somehow convinces a woman to ignite a trail of oil to initiate his scheme. Unbeknownst to Roberto, who was 
initially supposed to ambush Tenma on the second floor of the room and use his sniper rifle to kill Schuwald, Johan changes his 
mind and instead decides to give his goodbyes by showing the tycoon a scene from Hell. During the ceremony, as Johan aides Schuwald 
to the podium to make his speech, he whispers into the Schuwald's ear, "Many, many people to see you... A huge flock of them." Schuwald 
picks up on the allusion and orders all of the visitors to leave the building. It is too late, however, as Johan soon after cues for 
the swayed woman on the second floor to ignite the oil, thus setting all of the books alight and causing the visitors to panic and 
selfishly topple over each other.</p></font>

<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">As the books burn and the visitors 
try to escape, Johan calmly stands on the stage with an equally fearless Schuwald, and informs the tycoon that he no longer wants to 
kill him. When Schuwald asks him where he is from, Johan peers into his decrepit eyes and answers him, saying that he was born in a 
town straight out of a fairy tale, and that he and his other self were the only people in the world, nameless. This act and answer 
instills fear into Schuwald, leaving him wide-eyed and frantically shaking. Shortly afterwards, out of the smoke and flames comes 
Tenma. As he gets off the stage and begins to walk towards the doctor, Johan points to his forehead, tempting Tenma to shoot him. 
Just when it seems Tenma is going to perform the deed, Nina arrives and yells out to him, claiming that he must not shoot Johan. 
Unfazed by his sister's presence, Johan simply walks by Tenma into the smoke and flames and disappears.</p></font>

<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Johan later embarks to Prague, 
where he establishes his identity as "Anna Liebert" and begins emulating Nina by adopting her personality and sense of fashion. 
First, he murders Reinhart Biermann, the headmaster of Kinderheim 511 before his enrollment, as he was in possession of a tape 
from Johan's youth located in an undisclosed safety deposit box. He then tracks down Inspector Zeman and two of his subordinates, 
former members of the Czechoslovakian StB who are trying to obtain the tape for the purpose of selling it, to a factory setting 
where they were torturing Wolfgang Grimmer for information about the tape's location. Upon interrupting the interrogation, Johan 
(in his Anna disguise) shoots one of the subordinates in the head, before apparently allowing Wolfgang Grimmer to kill the other 
two by manifesting his "Magnificent Steiner" persona.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Johan thereafter begins to frequent a local bar, where he connects with Zeman's one-time 
protege, Detective Jan Suk, who is smitten with him (while in his Anna disguise). However, the courtship is merely a means to an end, 
as Johan, using poisoned whiskey bonbons, kills Suk's boss and other corrupt policemen involved with the StB who having been trying to 
obtain the tape in a manner similar to his previous poisonings, deflecting blame and suspicion for the murders onto Suk.</p></font>

  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:violet;"><p align="center">Johan disguissed as his sister</p></font>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px" align="justify">Johan's efforts to acquire the tape 
lead him to Suk's mother, who allows him to see it and copy over a message for Tenma. Meanwhile, in order to exonerate Grimmer from 
false suspicion of murdering Biermann, several of the orphans who were previously in his custody band together to find the "mysterious 
blonde lady," and one of them, Milosh, is successful. While acting under his Anna guise, Johan invites the boy back to his apartment 
and tells him he should find his lost mother, but cruelly imparts that if he cannot find her, then he had no place in the world; he 
then sends Milosh to look for his mother in a nearby red-light district, and it was only through Grimmer and Tenma's narrow intervention 
that the boy does not commit suicide after failing to find his mother and witnessing several forms of human depravity along the way.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px" align="justify">Before departing the city, Johan, with little else left to attend to in Prague, proceeds 
to burn down the Red Rose Mansion after giving a distant speech to his mother's portrait. He then encounters Hermann Fuhr and tells 
him about his scenery for a doomsday.</p></font>

<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Thereafter, Johan attends a high 
society gathering back in Germany, where Eva Heinemann, who has encountered him once before, points him out to Petr Capek , enabling 
his reunion with Christof Sievernich. In the weeks following their reunion, Johan manipulates multiple serial killers to murder three 
people in order to cover up Christof's various scandals.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px" align="justify">However, Johan has other matters to attend to as well, and proceeds to send the 
organization attempting to make him their leader into chaos and disarray. A stripper named Carmen garners the Baby's trust and 
then kills him, though it unknown whether she was hired by Johan or Christof, as the latter was on bad terms with the Baby. 
Johan then visits a paranoid Capek at his villa in Idstein to determine Bonaparta's current area of residence. Capek is able 
to supply him with the location of Bonaparta's son, Jaromir Lipsky.</p></font>

  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:violet;"><p align="center">Johan's reunion with Anna leads him to formulate his perfect 
suicide.</p></font>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">The Perfect suicide is Johan's last 
goal. He wants to erase himself from the world, and by doing so, he has to get rid of everyone who knows him and his past. Just like 
the character Johan in The Nameless Monster, he wants to be the last one to know his identity, before killing himself.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">After abandoning his plans, the last piece Johan needs to get rid of is Franz Bonaparta; 
before doing so, however, he finally meets with his sister and tells her about all horrible experiences he had supposedly underwent at 
the Red Rose Mansion. Nina tells him that he is wrong, revealing to him that the story is not his to tell, as she is the one who went 
to the mansion. He then listens to his sister's story, which leaves him smiling, yet saddened and tearful all the same. He leaves site 
of his and sister's reunion, as Nina is unable to shoot him after seeing the expression on his face.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Before executing his final plan, Johan visits Horst Grossman, his last remaining 
subordinate. Grossman greets Johan with tea and asks him who they are going to kill next. In response, Johan points to his forehead 
and puts a handgun on the table between him and Grossman, provoking the latter to shoot him. As Grossman takes the provocation as a 
joke, Johan stops pointing to his forehead and tells his associate, "I've awakened from the dream." Angered by this revelation, 
Grossman asks Johan what the purpose was of all the money he made and people he killed. Johan then informs Grossman that he has 
seen the end many times, but now can see a different scene-the true end-and knows where he needs to go. After further elaborating 
on his revelation, he then kills Grossman and leaves the premises.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Following Grossman's death, Johan goes to the remote village of Ruhenheim and destroys 
the town's peace by instigating a massacre by playing on the doubts, fears, and innate greed associated with human nature. In the 
midst of it all, he visits a small cottage on the edge of the town where he finds piles of drawings of himself and his sister as 
children. According to Nina, who visits the same place shortly after, he had been crying as he sorted through the unfinished 
sketches.</p></font>

<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:160%;" align="justify">Johan travels back to the center of 
town to meet Bonaparta and Tenma. After he arrives, Tenma immediately takes aim, but is then ambushed and disarmed by Bonaparta 
from behind. Bonaparta then aims the gun at Johan and suggests that the two die together. Before Bonaparta can shoot, he is 
executed by a gravely injured Roberto. Succumbing to his injuries, Roberto collapses to the ground and requests that Johan 
allow him to see the scenery of the doomsday, to which he is informed that he is not able to see it.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">With no one else left to interfere, Johan asks Tenma if he has finally realized that 
the only thing all humans are equal in is death. He then shows Tenma the scenery of the doomsday, which Tenma is temporarily 
overwhelmed by. Nina arrives on the scene and pleads with Tenma not to shoot Johan. She then tells her brother that she forgives 
him. Johan, however, rebuffs her forgiveness, claiming that some things can never be amended and there is no turning back. He then 
tries to provoke Tenma into killing him by holding a gun to the head of a young boy, Wim Knaup, but instead is shot by the boy's 
alcoholic father, who describes him as a monster with seven heads and many horns.</p></font>

  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:violet;"><p align="center">Johan imparts to Tenma a memory only he possesses — the memory 
of his mother's choice that has affected him so dearly.</p></font>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">With urging from both Nina and 
Heinrich Lunge, Johan is operated on and saved yet again by Dr. Tenma. After having visited Johan's mother, Tenma pays him a visit 
in the state police hospital where the patient has been unconscious ever since the massacre.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Believing that he is speaking to a comatose Johan, Tenma informs Johan of his recent 
work with Doctors without Borders and how life has progressed since Ruhenheim. During this secluded meeting, Tenma tenderly shares 
that Johan indeed had a name. Abruptly, Johan appears to jolt from his coma and sit up staring at Tenma. Horrified and seemingly 
paralyzed, Tenma silently listens as Johan begins retelling the story of his mother's choice and pointedly asks the doctor to 
explain who was the unwanted child, trapped with wondering if his mother accidentally made a mistake. They are left with a 
single question: "Who is the real monster?"</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">However, it is unclear whether this conversation is a hallucination that Tenma 
experiences or if its actually real. Either way, as if awakening from a dream, Tenma gives no response and departs shortly 
thereafter. Johan's fate following this is unclear, but his hospital bed is seen empty in the ending credits with a breeze 
blowing in from an open window, ambiguously implying that Johan either escaped from the hospital and continued his vengeful 
path, if he died while in a comatose state, or if he committed suicide after finally learning his true identity.</p></font>

  <left><font style="font-size: 30px;color:orange;"><b>Nina Fortner</b></font></left>
  <br>
  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Nina is Johan's twin sister. 
After they were separated from their mother, he repeatedly murdered their foster parents, unbeknownst to Nina. Since they were 
all that they had, Johan expresses great attachment to his sister and often described her as his other self, tending to refer 
to the fact that they are the same person - an increasingly disturbing case of their conflicting identities. As a child, she 
was the only person other than his mother Johan has expressed empathy for, crying after she told him about her traumatic 
experiences in the Red Rose Mansion even pleading aloud, "Please, don't make me forget Anna. It's only Anna and me in this world."</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Nina, for her part, is terrified of her brother for various reasons. At one point in their 
youth, Nina had shot him at his insistence, but he was saved by the doctor that the twins would later associate with, both perceiving 
him as a sort of "father" figure. After their separation, he repeatedly stalks Nina. His quote declaring that "I was born to smother 
you with flowers" suggests a genuine love for his sister, despite his actions hurting her as shown in his murder of her foster parents. 
Nina, however, is the only person, other than Tenma, Johan does not try to kill. After regaining her memories of her childhood and 
discovering that he killed the Lieberts, Nina becomes determined to kill him and he once again tries to goad her into shooting him, 
but she spares him and forgives him because she still cannot kill her brother after everything they went through.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">It is later revealed that the twins' mother used to dress Johan up in the same girl's 
clothing as Nina to create the illusion of having only one child. The children were dressed identically when Bonaparta came to take 
one of the twins and their mother decided to send Nina in the end, but her hesitation led Johan to believe that she intended to send 
Johan and simply mistook his sister for him. Johan convinced himself that Nina's painful memories of her time at the Red Rose Mansion 
were his own, alluding to a deep connection with his sister and perhaps resentment towards their mother.</p></font>
<br>
<left><font style="font-size: 30px;color:orange;"><b>Kenzo Tenma</b></font></left>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Tenma saved Johan's life when he 
was a child, unaware of the villainy within him. Tenma would later spend several years (after a 9 year period of peace, in which he 
is unaware that Johan was responsible for the Eisler Memorial Hospital murders) tracking down Johan out of a sense of guilt and 
responsibility for the "monster" he brought back from the grave.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">He is one of only two characters Johan has shown any care for, the other being his 
sister. It is implied that a core reason for Johan's actions are an attempt to see how far Tenma would go to stop him, yet Johan 
is also shown to genuinely respect Tenma both as a father figure and as an opponent.</p></font>

<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Johan, dressed as Anna, manipulated 
Suk into revealing info of his case and put him in a situation similar to Tenma when he poisoned Suks' superiors.</p></font>
<br>
<left><font style="font-size: 30px;color:orange;"><b>Hermann Fuhr</b></font></left>
<br>
<font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">While the exact nature of their 
relationship is unknown, Fuhr's status as Bonaparta's superior pupil and Johan's connections to Bonaparta, intertwined their fates. 
The two have had only one known meeting, when Johan encountered Fuhr when he was burning down the Red Rose Mansion and showed him 
his scenery for a doomsday. This sparked Fuhr's desire to kill Eugan Molke and the events of Another Monster. Notably, Fuhr is one 
of the only people Johan has considered worthy to see his scenery for a doomsday and is the author of his favorite book.</p></font>

  <hr color="yellow" size="1">
  <br>
  <font style="font-size: 20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">Johan possesses genius-level 
intelligence and he is capable of perfectly memorizing anything. His school teachers remark that he easily maintained perfect grades. 
While investigating Johan, Richard Brown also deduces that he had a reputation of being at the top of his class with perfect grades at 
the gymnasium (school) he went to. Johan is prodigiously brilliant in whatever he studies and has a natural aptitude for attaining new 
talents; picking up complicated skills quickly and retaining them. This is noted by Schuwald, when praising Johan's knowledge of law 
and economics, and by Karl, who notes that none could surpass Johan in anything. He is multilingual; in addition to the Latin he rapidly 
learns and masters while volunteering as one of Schuwald's readers, at twelve years of age, Johan is also able to become perfectly fluent 
in both English and French within a thirteen-month period. At the age of only fifteen, he starts and presides over an underground bank, 
a feat requiring perfect intuition and flawless intuitive understanding of mathematics, economics, trade, business, politics, management, 
and leadership. Schuwald's conclusion is further proof of Johan's vast understanding of economics: he decides that if anything is to 
happen to him, Johan will take over his place as opposed to Karl Neuman, his own son.</p>
<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify">He is physically and genetically perfect, he possesses a monstrous charisma and an 
inhuman prowess for manipulation. He is highly proficient at analysis and deduction, especially when it comes to the human psyche, 
and can instantly gain direct access to people's cores, hitting their weak spots, acknowledging their worth, and figuring out their 
mental processes, and manipulate them easily thereafter. He possess innate understanding/knowledge of psychology. He understand how 
the mind works to the smallest details. Allows him to detect lies, and perform perfect cold-readings. He can use it for various purposes, 
often changing the perception or behavior of others through underhanded, deceptive, even abusive tactics. He could use it to help those 
with mental or emotional problems, but instead he use it to manipulate others into doing his bidding, even drive some to acts of murder 
or suicide. What he is especially good at is unlocking the "monster" in other people, bringing out their inner darkness and making them 
accept it like he has. He does not feel fear, guilt, regret, loneliness or pain. Johan leaves such a strong impression on people that he 
is able to convince legions to do whatever he wants, such as commit murder, play suicide games, or do other monstrous things after just a 
single encounter. According to Heinrich Lunge, this process is done by altering the fulcrum of someone's identity, like removing a map's 
coordinate axis. The more jumbled their "lines" become without that foundation, the more room he has to redraw or redefine their maps. He 
is a very eloquent speaker, orator, and story-teller, by nature he is incredibly persuasive and charming. Able to bring anyone to 
understand and feel for his viewpoint, even large audiences.</p></font>
