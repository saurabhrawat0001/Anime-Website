<br><br>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify"><font style="font-size:20px;">Naoki Urasawa (Hepburn: Urasawa Naoki, born January 2, 1960) is 
a Japanese manga artist and musician. He has been drawing manga since he was four years old, and for most of his professional career has 
created two series simultaneously. The stories to many of these were co-written in collaboration with his former editor, Takashi Nagasaki. 
Urasawa has been called one of the artists that changed the history of manga and has won numerous awards, including the Shogakukan Manga 
Award three times, the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize twice, and the Kodansha Manga Award once. By December 2021, his various works had over 
140 million copies in circulation worldwide.</font></p>

<br><br><br>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify"><font style="font-size:20px;">Urasawa's first major work was illustrating the action series 
Pineapple Army (1985–1988), which was written by Kazuya Kudo. The first serial that he wrote and illustrated himself, and his first major 
success, was the sports manga Yawara! (1986-1993). He then illustrated the adventure series Master Keaton (1988-1994), which was written 
by Hokusei Katsushika and Nagasaki, and created the sports manga Happy! (1993-1999). The thriller Monster (1994-2001) was his first to 
receive international acclaim and success, which continued with the science fiction mystery 20th Century Boys (1999-2006). Following the 
acclaimed Pluto (2003-2009), which is a re-imagining of Astro Boy by Osamu Tezuka, one of Urasawa's biggest influences, he and Nagasaki 
created the mystery series Billy Bat (2008-2016). After two short series, a sequel to Master Keaton with Nagasaki and Mujirushi: The Sign 
of Dreams, Urasawa began his currently ongoing Asadora! in 2018.</font></p>

<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify"><font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;">When Urasawa visited Shogakukan to apply for 
a business job, he decided to bring some manga he had drawn out of curiosity.An editor from Weekly Shonen Sunday did not give him the time 
of day, but the head editor of Big Comic Original happened to walk by and felt the work was better suited for Big Comic Spirits, and took 
Urasawa to their editorial department. He ended up submitting manga for their 1982 New Manga Artist Award, which his unpublished work 
"Return" won. It was only then that he thought about becoming a professional manga artist.It was a year after winning the award that 
Urasawa met Takashi Nagasaki, who would become his longtime editor and collaborator.</font></p>

his professional debut in 1983 with "Beta!", which was published in a special issue of Golgo 13.He then created the short serialized work 
Dancing Policeman the following year. Urasawa began his first major serialized work, Pineapple Army, in 1985 in the semimonthly Big Comic 
Original. He was the illustrator of the series, while Kazuya Kudo was its writer. It ended in 1988 and was collected into eight tankōbon 
volumes. While working on Pineapple Army, Urasawa began Yawara! in the weekly Big Comic Spirits in 1986 which he wrote and illustrated 
himself.It earned him the 1989 Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category.That same year it was adapted into a live-action film and 
an anime television series. It ended in 1993 and was collected into 29 volumes.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 30px;" align="justify"><font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;">When Pineapple Army ended, Urasawa began 
Master Keaton for Big Comic Original in November 1988. He illustrated it, while Hokusei Katsushika wrote it. It ended in August 1994 and 
was collected into 18 volumes. An anime television adaptation began in 1998, before finishing as an original video animation in 2000. 
Likewise when Yawara! ended, Urasawa began another solo series in Big Comic Spirits. Happy! ran from 1993 until 1999 and was collected 
into 23 volumes. It was adapted into two live-action television films in 2006.</font></p>

Manga Award in the General category, and his third Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category in 2002.It ended in 2006 and was
