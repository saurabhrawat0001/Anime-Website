<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Inspector Heinrich Lunge is the 
main deuteragonist of the series, He is an officer employed in the BKA, who obsessively believes that Dr. Kenzo Tenma is responsible 
for a series of murders and criminal events taking place in Germany, and doggedly pursues him to that end. He lives for his work, and 
pridefully states that no case he ever has taken on has ended without a resolution. He possesses extremely high analytical abilities, 
and has an excellent memory. However, he is ultimately forced to confront and contend with the "fairy-tale" reality that surrounds him 
when he comes to realize that Tenma is not in fact responsible, but no less than the mysterious Johan Liebert, the "monster" Tenma had 
referred to in his testimonies, is in fact the guilty party.</p>

     <summary><b>Biography</b></summary>
     <hr color="yellow" size="1">
<font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p align="justify">Lunge first appears after the funeral of Udo Heinemann, 
since he has</p></font>

<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">been assigned to investigate the 
murders of the director, Dr. Eisen, and Doctor Boyer. He meets with Dr. Kenzo Tenma and interrogates him, after which he hypothesizes 
that Tenma must be responsible for their deaths since he is the only person who has something to gain and also has a reasonable 
motive (having been demoted after performing surgery on Johan Liebert). Due to a lack of evidence, the case makes little 
progression for about ten years, but Lunge remains certain that Tenma is a murderer.</p>
</font>
<br>
<h3><b>Middle-aged couple murders</b></h3>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Ten years later, he is investigating 
the serial killings of middle-aged couples, and concludes that a man by the name of Adolf Junkers is involved. Junkers is, however, 
hit by a car after barely escaping death by the hand of Johan. He receives treatment from Doctor Tenma, and Lunge impatiently waits 
to interrogate him. Still sure Tenma killed the three doctors ten years ago, he assigns a guard to watch over Junkers until he's ready 
to confess in order to make sure some 'unfortunate' accident doesn't occur. Around this time, Johan has caught up with him, and after 
finding his guard poisoned, Junkers runs out of the hospital. Tenma chases after him and they arrive at an abandoned building. There, 
Junkers is executed and Tenma reunites with his former patient Johan, who provides him an explanation for the many deaths surrounding 
him.</p></font>

<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">The following day, Tenma gives his 
testimony to Lunge, but his story is highly unbelievable and only supports the theory that he is insane. Lunge theorizes that Johan 
Liebert is a fabrication of Tenma's mind, suggesting he has dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder); the kind, 
loving doctor and the vicious killer must be one and the same. Around this time, he is also working on another case, but pushes too 
far and an important witness commits suicide. As a result, his superiors tell him he needs to take some time off and clear his head; 
he is then removed from all cases but one- that of Doctor Tenma. Later, he goes home to find that his wife and daughter are leaving 
him. Their claim is that he is so fixated on his work that he didn't even notice his wife was having an affair, or that his daughter 
had become pregnant. At this point, Lunge is now alone and has nothing to work on, but decides to take this opportunity to start 
pursuing Tenma full time.</p></font>
<br>
<h3><b>Chasing Tenma</b></h3>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Lunge was a great detective, but after 
the doctors in Eisler memorial hospital died he became biased and obsessed with trying to find evidence that Tenma was guilty of the 
murders. He did not want to believe that he was wrong. This kept him from solving the case sooner, as he only realizes that he is 
wrong at the end of the series. Tenma now has left to go hunting for the "monster" Johan Liebert and has found himself on the wanted 
list as a suspect for murder. Tenma and Lunge enter a game of cat-and-mouse and come into contact a few times, but Tenma always</p></font>

<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px; " align="justify">escapes. At one point, he even 
saves Lunge's life, who was going to die of blood loss due to a stab wound he received from a paranoid murderer whose actions 
implied that he was just begging to be caught. On several occasions, Tenma's former university peer and renowned criminal 
psychologist, Dr. Rudy Gillen, approached Lunge and tried to convince him of Tenma's innocence, presenting him with a compelling 
case for Johan's involvement, which Lunge readily dismissed. However, after arriving in Munich and investigating the young man 
attending university known as Johan Liebert, he begins to suspect that perhaps his calculations were wrong and that Johan really 
does exist. After going through Moravia Publishing Company's archives where he finds sketches of the twins drawn by Franz Bonaparta, 
he becomes certain of his error. After Tenma is captured with the help of Tomas Zobak, he whispers to him in the police station that 
the hardest people to interrogate are the ones who say nothing at all, cryptically signifying the fact that he now believes in Tenma's 
claim.</p></font>

<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">After Tenma escapes from prison, he 
begins investigating the mysterious Franz Bonaparta. He receives a painting of the place he lives in from Bonaparta's son, Jarom√≠r 
Lipsky, and tours southern Germany until coming across the town of Ruhenheim, which matches the artwork. There, he works with Wolfgang 
Grimmer to help stop the upcoming massacre, but is unable to in time, and the town plunges into paranoia and violence as a result of 
Johan's orchestrations. He and Grimmer part ways, and promise that after the incident is over they'll go out for beer. Lunge finally 
confronts Tenma face to face, and admits his error, because he now knows that the fairy tale "monster" Tenma described really does 
exist. Following that, he confronts Roberto in the Hotel Bergbach, and receives some near fatal</p></font>

in return. Roberto tries to provoke him by saying how low he's fallen, that chasing Tenma is his reason for living, then goes even 
further and taunts Lunge about his shambles of a personal life. Lunge's calm finally shatters for the first time in recent memory, 
and he engages Roberto in a vicious shootout which devolves into close quarters combat. Lunge threatens Roberto by jamming a gun in 
his mouth, angrily demanding to know who Roberto is and just where Johan is located. He slips into unconsciousness and Roberto 
escapes, </p></font>

his request to see the "Scenery for a Doomsday" is declined. When police and medics arrive, Lunge's wounds are treated. He tells the 
doctors that there is a man in town, Kenzo Tenma, who can save Johan's life, which leads to our horribly ironic ending. Later, he 
testifies concerning Tenma's innocence.</p></font>
<br>
<h3><b>The End</b></h3>
 <br>
 <center><a href="img04/8.jpg"><img src="img04/8.jpg" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Several months after the incident, 
Lunge retires as an officer of the BKA and becomes a professor at a police academy, which he says gives him a lot more free time 
to spend with his daughter and grandson (though most contact is via email). In his final scene, Lunge is seen with Fritz Verdemann 
and Jan Suk standing around Grimmer's grave, where he places a beer and comments on his curiosity about how much people really 
communicate throughout the duration of their lives, then adds he believes there is probably a lot Grimmer would have wanted to 
talk about over a nice, cold beer.</p></font>

     <summary><b>Personality</b></summary>
     <hr color="yellow" size="1">
<font style="font-size:20px;color:lightgreen;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Lunge is cold, ruthless, efficient, 
and eminently calculating, so much so that it occasionally gets him into trouble, even driving some of his suspects to suicide. His
job is his life, and making a mistake in his eyes is a fate worse than death. Lunge's sole mission in life is to catch criminals, 
and he considers everything else, such as interpersonal relationships, games such as chess, and even sleep to be uninteresting wastes 
of time better spent in pursuit of investigation.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Lunge's ruthless tenacity and cold, calculating demeanor are shown in his encounter with 
the copycat killer in episode 22, in which he knowingly releases false information into the local newspaper to entice Tenma to the 
scene. In his interview with the actual murderer, Lunge toys with him, sarcastically telling him that he will certainly get away with 
his crime because the local police are incompetent. Lunge tells the culprit he has no interest in any other criminal but Tenma, and 
this is put to the test when the copycat murderer later attacks Lunge. After being stabbed from behind, Lunge shoots out both the 
suspect's kneecaps and doggedly pursues Tenma to his car, only to lose consciousness from blood loss. Upon regaining consciousness, 
Lunge promptly handcuffs and incapacitates Tenma despite needing his medical expertise to survive. This clearly indicates Lunge's 
resolve and ruthless dedication to the pursuit of criminals even at the cost of his own life.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Although his family life hasn't been shown in the series for the most part, one can 
deduce just by his confession that he's not on good terms with his family that he's not keen on making good relationships with 
others, nor is he enthusiastic about keeping in touch with them. By the end of the series though, it is seen that he has changed 
this attitude and started making contact with his daughter.</p></font>
