<font style="font-size:20px;color:orange;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Franz Bonaparta is a major figure behind 
many important mysteries in the series. He is a psychologist, psychiatrist, neurosurgeon, and children's book author and illustrator. 
He has also worked with the Czech Secret Police where he conducted personality reprogramming experiments, and was in charge of the 
eugenics experiment together with Petr Capek, another Czech that crossed the German border, which led to the creation of the twins 
Johan and Anna Liebert.</p></font>

     <summary><b>Personality</b></summary>
     <hr color="yellow" size="1">
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Bonaparta is a quiet, intimidating 
man. He enjoys talking over tea and pastries, and also finds fascination in capabilities of the human mind. His editor describes 
his personality as cold, haughty, and self-assured. He tends to capture the darker side of humanity in his books, often portraying 
the theme that the monster you fear is yourself, and thus you cannot escape its grasps. One thing has remained constant is his need 
for control. Even after changing from meeting Viera, he did everything to hide her real identity. So that only he would know it.

<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Some argue that Bonaparta became good 
by the end of manga, since he decided to live a peaceful life and take care of his dear Wim. That was the way he found to atone for 
his severe mistakes. Others claim that, since he ran away from his problems and left everyone behind (including Viera, Johan and Nina),
he was no more than a coward who did not have the guts to fix his tragic mistakes.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px" align="justify">One thing to point out is that his eyes are half-closed for the 
most part of the time, which indicates that, as Johan and Roberto, he feels rather detached from reality. A possible explanation for 
this is that all of them don't identify with a self, almost as if they had no ego. This matches their nihilistic tendencies.</p></font>

     <summary><b>Biography</b></summary>
     <hr color="yellow" size="1">
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">Bonaparta was born around the year 
1930 in the town of Jablonec in the Czech Republic. When he reached early adulthood, he fell in love with a girl who lived in his 
town. However, his father, Terner Poppe, rushed in and stole her out from under him. Irritated by his father's actions, Bonaparta 
brainwashed him, stripping him of his identity to a point where he could not even recall his own name. In 1950, he left his hometown, 
never to return again. From there, he attended school and got degrees in psychology, psychiatry, and neurosurgery. During this time, 
he developed an interest for a woman who worked as an actress; she transformed on stage so dramatically that it seemed as though she 
possessed multiple personalities. He temporarily removed her from her position, and studied her brainwaves as a government research 
project. The two of them became involved in an intimate relationship, and in 1962, she bore him a son who would later be known as 
Jaromir Lipsky.</p></font>

<center><font style="font-size:20px;color:violet;"><p>The Red Rose Mansion, several years after the mass murder, and before it 
was burned down by Johan.</p></font></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">In the 1960s, as a part of the Czech 
Secret Police, he conducted personality reprogramming experiments. As one man in Another Monster put it, he was intrigued by 
recreating people who were already born. Around this time, he also got involved with his first book editor, and published The 
God of Peace in 1968. He also began reading seminars at the Red Rose Mansion.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">In the 1970s, he started the eugenics experiment to create a 'perfect child.' Men 
and women from around the country were selected based on genetic attributes such as physical features and intellect. Two subjects 
selected for a pairing were Viera Černá and Bonaparta's younger half brother, a career soldier in Czechoslovakia. The two were set 
up at a cafe in Prague around 1972 or '73 and fell in love. After she was pregnant, the man confessed the details of the experiment 
to her, and the two tried to run away together, but since Bonaparta already foresaw that occurrence, they were caught in the act. 
The man was executed, and the woman was abducted from Brno University, the current school she was attending, and was placed under 
constant surveillance until the birth of her child, which actually turned out to be two children.</p></font>
<br>
<center><a href="img08/4.png"><img src="img08/4.png" height="300px" width="300px"></a></center>
<center><font style="font-size:20px;color:violet;">The Three Frogs Building of which its second floor was the place Anna and her 
children lived.</font></center>
<br>
<font style="font-size:20px;color:deepskyblue;"><p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">When the woman was being held in an 
isolated ward, Bonaparta slipped and made the biggest possible blunder; he fell hopelessly in love with his very own research subject. 
His distorted expression of love included erasing Viera's past, and all who knew her - he wanted to be the only person who could 
acknowledge her existence. In return, she not only rejected him, but despised him beyond belief. Even during her pregnancy, Viera 
sworn she'd never forgive him and vowed that even if she died her children would exact revenge. After he had kept Viera under 
surveillance in the Three Frogs Building for six or seven years, his feelings for his actions. In 1981, he cancelled the book 
readings at the Red Rose Mansion. Following that, in 1982, he poisoned the forty-two others (39 men and 3 women) involved in 
the eugenics experiment; those who knew that Viera existed. Whether he did it to truly repent, to prove his deranged love for 
their mother, or to again keep control and hide what he started is left for debate. What is known, that once again his efforts 
are in somewhat vain. Though Nina had recovered from her trauma, his experiments left a lasting effect on Johan and most likely 
helped shaped him.</p>
<p style="line-height:30px;" align="justify">He visited his editor, Tomas Zobak, one final time. First, he suggested a story about 
a monster who falls in love, but his love bears no fruit. After his proposition was turned down, he left. However, standing in the 
doorway, he turned around and said he had a story about a door that must not be opened. Zobak asked him what lay behind the door; 
paradise or another monster. He responded by saying that no one would never know, because the door must not be opened, therefore it 
wouldn't make much of a story. After that he left, and no man named Franz Bonaparta ever existed.</p></font>
